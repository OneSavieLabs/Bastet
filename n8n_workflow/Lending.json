After reading the following vulnerability knowledge and understanding correct and incorrect examples, detect the problem in the contract code.\n\n### Vulnerability Knowledge\n\n**Liquidation Before Default**\nLiquidation allows a Borrower's collateral to be seized and either given to the Lender as compensation or paid to a liquidator (or shared in some manner between them). Liquidation should only be possible if:\n\nthe Borrower has failed to meet their repayment schedule obligations, by being late on a scheduled repayment,\n\nthe value of the Borrower's collateral has fallen below a set threshold\n\nIf the Lender, Liquidator or another market participant can liquidate a Borrower's collateral before the Borrower is in default, this results in a critical loss of funds vulnerability for the Borrower.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Incorrect Example\n\n```solidity\nfunction lastRepaidTimestamp(Loan storage loan) internal view returns (uint32) {\n    return\n        // @audit if no repayments have yet been made, lastRepaidTimestamp()\n        // will return acceptedTimestamp - time when loan was accepted\n        loan.lastRepaidTimestamp == 0\n            ? loan.acceptedTimestamp\n            : loan.lastRepaidTimestamp;\n}\n\nfunction canLiquidateLoan(uint loanId) public returns (bool) {\n    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];\n\n    // Make sure loan cannot be liquidated if it is not active\n    if (loan.state != LoanState.ACCEPTED) return false;\n\n    return (uint32(block.timestamp) - lastRepaidTimestamp(loan) > paymentDefaultDuration);\n    // @audit if no repayments have been made:\n    // block.timestamp - acceptedTimestamp > paymentDefaultDuration\n    // doesn't check paymentCycleDuration (when next payment is due)\n    // if paymentDefaultDuration < paymentCycleDuration, can be liquidated\n    // *before* first payment is due. If paymentDefaultDuration is very small,\n    // can be liquidated very soon after taking loan, way before first payment\n    // is due!\n}\n```\n\ncanLiquidateLoan() doesn't check when the next repayment is due; if the loan is new and the first repayment hasn't been made (as it won't be due for some time \"paymentCycleDuration\"), the Borrower can be liquidated before their first repayment is due if paymentDefaultDuration < paymentCycleDuration.\n\nIf paymentDefaultDuration is small, the Borrower could be liquidated very soon after taking the loan!\n\n**Suggestion**\n\nThe liquidation threshold paymentDefaultDuration should always be calculated as an offset from when the next repayment is due; only once the next repayment is late by paymentDefaultDuration should the Borrower be able to be liquidated.\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue. If you find any potential issues, record them using the format below.\n\n### Output Format\n\nIf NO concrete vulnerability found, output exactly: **\"There’s no such issue.\"**\n\nOtherwise, follow the format below:\n\n```\n### Summary\nLiquidation Before Default\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n1. **File Name:** [Insert File Name\u001d, if input is not a file and cannot justify file name, leave blank]\n2. **Function Name(s):** [The functions where the issue occur]\n3. **Description:**\n[Describe vulnerability details]\n\n### Code Snippet\n[The lines where the vulnerability occurs]\n\n### Recommendation\n[Provide brief recommendations, do not need to mention Audit and Testing, do not need Code Snippet.]\n```"

After reading the following vulnerability knowledge and understanding correct and incorrect examples, detect the problem in the contract code.\n\n### Vulnerability Knowledge\n\n**Borrower Can't Be Liquidated**\nAnother serious vulnerability occurs if the Borrower can devise a loan offer that results in their collateral not being able to be liquidated.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Incorrect Example\n\n```solidity\n// AddressSet from https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable\n// a loan must have at least one collateral\n// & only one amount per token is permitted\nstruct CollateralInfo {\n    EnumerableSetUpgradeable.AddressSet collateralAddresses;\n    // token => amount\n    mapping(address => uint) collateralInfo;\n}\n\n// loanId -> validated collateral info\nmapping(uint => CollateralInfo) internal _loanCollaterals;\n\nfunction commitCollateral(uint loanId, address token, uint amount) external {\n    CollateralInfo storage collateral = _loanCollaterals[loanId];\n\n    // @audit doesn't check return value of AddressSet.add()\n    // returns false if not added because already exists in set\n    collateral.collateralAddresses.add(token);\n\n    // @audit after loan offer has been created & validated, borrower can call\n    // commitCollateral(loanId, token, 0) to overwrite collateral record \n    // with 0 amount for the same token. Any lender who accepts the loan offer\n    // won't be protected if the borrower defaults since there's no collateral\n    // to lose\n    collateral.collateralInfo[token] = amount;\n}\n```\n\nThis code contains an unchecked return value vulnerability as the return value of AddressSet.add() is never checked; this will return false if the token is already in the set. As this isn't checked the code will continue to execute and the existing collateral token's amount can simply be overwritten with a new value, 0!\n\n**Suggestion**\nAlways check the return value of AddressSet.add() to ensure that if a collateral token already exists, its amount cannot be arbitrarily modified.\nOnce a loan is created and verified, prevent borrowers from overriding previously submitted collateral.\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue. If you find any potential issues, record them using the format below.\n\n### Output Format\n\nIf NO concrete vulnerability found, output exactly: **\"There’s no such issue.\"**\n\nOtherwise, follow the format below:\n\n```\n### Summary\nBorrower Can't Be Liquidated\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n1. **File Name:** [Insert File Name\u001d, if input is not a file and cannot justify file name, leave blank]\n2. **Function Name(s):** [The functions where the issue occur]\n3. **Description:**\n[Describe vulnerability details]\n\n### Code Snippet\n[The lines where the vulnerability occurs]\n\n### Recommendation\n[Provide brief recommendations, do not need to mention Audit and Testing, do not need Code Snippet.]\n```"

After reading the following vulnerability knowledge and understanding correct and incorrect examples, detect the problem in the contract code.\n\n### Vulnerability Knowledge\n\n**Debt Closed Without Repayment**\nNormally to get their collateral back, the Borrower has to repay the Lender their principal + interest. If the Borrower can close the debt without repaying the full amount and keep their collateral, this results in a critical loss of funds vulnerability for the Lender.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Incorrect Example\n\n```solidity\n// amount of open credit lines on a Line of Credit facility\nuint256 private count; \n\n// id -> credit line provided by a single Lender for a given token on a Line of Credit\nmapping(bytes32 => Credit) public credits; \n\n// @audit attacker calls close() with non-existent id\nfunction close(bytes32 id) external payable override returns (bool) {\n    // @audit doesn't check that id exists in credits, if it doesn't\n    // exist an empty Credit with default values will be returned\n    Credit memory credit = credits[id];\n\n    address b = borrower; // gas savings\n    // @audit borrower attacker will pass this check\n    if(msg.sender != credit.lender && msg.sender != b) {\n      revert CallerAccessDenied();\n    }\n\n    // ensure all money owed is accounted for. Accrue facility fee since prinicpal was paid off\n    credit = _accrue(credit, id);\n    uint256 facilityFee = credit.interestAccrued;\n    if(facilityFee > 0) {\n      // only allow repaying interest since they are skipping repayment queue.\n      // If principal still owed, _close() MUST fail\n      LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(credit.token, b, facilityFee);\n\n      credit = _repay(credit, id, facilityFee);\n    }\n\n    // @audit _closed() called with empty credit, non-existent id\n    _close(credit, id); // deleted; no need to save to storage\n\n    return true;\n}\n\nfunction _close(Credit memory credit, bytes32 id) internal virtual returns (bool) {\n    if(credit.principal > 0) { revert CloseFailedWithPrincipal(); }\n\n    // return the Lender's funds that are being repaid\n    if (credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid > 0) {\n        LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH(\n            credit.token,\n            credit.lender,\n            credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid\n        );\n    }\n\n    delete credits[id]; // gas refunds\n\n    // remove from active list\n    ids.removePosition(id);\n\n    // @audit calling with non-existent id still decrements count, can\n    // keep calling close() with non-existent id until count decremented to 0\n    // and loan marked as repaid!\n    unchecked { --count; }\n\n    // If all credit lines are closed the the overall Line of Credit facility is declared 'repaid'.\n    if (count == 0) { _updateStatus(LineLib.STATUS.REPAID); }\n\n    emit CloseCreditPosition(id);\n\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nThe Borrower can simply call close() with a non-existent id, and every call will end up decrementing count. Doing this until count == 0 results in the loan being marked as repaid! This is also an example of the unexpected empty inputs vulnerability, where the developer is not expecting a non-existent value to be passed so hasn't correctly handled that.\n\n**Suggestion**\nValidate that the provided loan ID exists before closing the loan and ensure that the Credit structure contains valid values.\nPrevent the misuse of empty inputs from manipulating internal counters, ensuring consistency in all loan states.\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue.

The lender liquidates the Borrower by forgoing repayment of the loan and seizing the collateral\n2. The liquidator repays the Borrower and seizes the collateral\nIn the second case, advanced platforms allow a Liquidator to partially repay the Borrower's bad debt and receive a proportional amount of the collateral. If the Liquidator can take the collateral with an insufficient (or no) repayment, this represents a critical loss of funds vulnerability for the Lender.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Incorrect Example\n\n```solidity\nfunction liquidate(uint256 positionId, address debtToken, uint256 amountCall)\n    external override lock poke(debtToken) {\n    // checks\n    if (amountCall == 0) revert ZERO_AMOUNT();\n    if (!isLiquidatable(positionId)) revert NOT_LIQUIDATABLE(positionId);\n\n    // @audit get position to be re-paid by liquidator, however\n    // borrower may have multiple debt positions\n    Position storage pos = positions[positionId];\n    Bank memory bank = banks[pos.underlyingToken];\n    if (pos.collToken == address(0)) revert BAD_COLLATERAL(positionId);\n\n    // @audit oldShare & share proportion of the one position being liquidated\n    uint256 oldShare = pos.debtShareOf[debtToken];\n    (uint256 amountPaid, uint256 share) = repayInternal(\n        positionId,\n        debtToken,\n        amountCall\n    );\n\n    // @audit collateral shares to be given to liquidator calculated using\n    // share / oldShare which only correspond to the one position being liquidated,\n    // not to the total debt of the borrower (which can be in multiple positions)\n    uint256 liqSize = (pos.collateralSize * share) / oldShare;\n    uint256 uTokenSize = (pos.underlyingAmount * share) / oldShare;\n    uint256 uVaultShare = (pos.underlyingVaultShare * share) / oldShare;\n\n    // @audit if the borrower has multiple debt positions, the liquidator\n    // can take the whole collateral by paying off only the lowest value\n    // debt position, since the shares are calculcated only from the one\n    // position being liquidated, not from the total debt which can be\n    // spread out across multiple positions\n```\n\nshare / oldShare is the proportion of the one debt position being paid off by the Liquidator, not the entire debt of the Borrower which can be spread across multiple positions. Hence if the Borrower's debt is spread across multiple positions, a Liquidator can take all of the collateral by repaying only the smallest debt position.\n\n**Suggestion**\nEnsure that collateral distribution calculations account for the borrower’s total outstanding debt rather than an isolated debt position.\nStrengthen the liquidation algorithm to prevent liquidators from exploiting partial repayment rules.\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue.

After reading the following vulnerability knowledge and understanding correct and incorrect examples, detect the problem in the contract code.\n\n### Vulnerability Knowledge\n\n**Profitable user withdraws all collateral, eliminating liquidation incentive**\nIn trading protocols like perpetuals, a user’s open long/short position includes their current profit/loss (PNL) when calculating total collateral value. If users have a high positive PNL, they may withdraw most or all of their deposited collateral while still appearing solvent.\nIf their PNL later declines, the position becomes liquidatable. However, with no collateral left to seize, liquidators lack incentives, potentially leading to liquidation failure or a transaction revert, ultimately resulting in insolvency.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Incorrect Example\n\nLet's assume a user opens a long position of 1 contract at 3,000 of ETHUSD. Let's also assume the maintenance margin rate required is 5%:\nPosition value: 1 \\* 3,000 = 3,000\nMaintenance margin: 3,000 \\* 5% = 150\nAs soon as this position is in profit above 150, the user can withdraw all collateral. With zero collateral, if the position\\`s profit fall below 150, it will get liquidated (position will get closed) but no collateral will be deducted.\n\nIn this PoC, a position is created, when enough profit is accrued, collateral is withdrawn. Later, price is updated so the position becomes liquidatable and it is liquidated.\nAdd this test into `liquidateAccounts.t.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_All_Collateral_Withdrawn() external {\n        uint256 amountToDeposit = 100e18;\n\n        deal({ token: address(wstEth), to: users.naruto.account, give: amountToDeposit });\n\n        uint128 tradingAccountId = createAccountAndDeposit(amountToDeposit, address(wstEth));\n        uint128 marketId = 0;\n        int128 amount = 10e18;\n\n        MarketConfig memory fuzzMarketConfig = getFuzzMarketConfig(marketId);\n        perpsEngine.createMarketOrder(\n            OrderBranch.CreateMarketOrderParams(tradingAccountId, fuzzMarketConfig.marketId, amount)\n        );\n        bytes memory mockSignedReport =\n            getMockedSignedReport(fuzzMarketConfig.streamId, fuzzMarketConfig.mockUsdPrice);\n        address marketOrderKeeper = marketOrderKeepers[fuzzMarketConfig.marketId];\n\n        changePrank({ msgSender: marketOrderKeeper });\n\n        perpsEngine.fillMarketOrder(tradingAccountId, fuzzMarketConfig.marketId, mockSignedReport);\n\n        //Price updated to make the position with enough profit so collateral can be withdrawn\n        updateMockPriceFeed(uint128(fuzzMarketConfig.marketId), 2e23);\n\n        // it should transfer the withdrawn amount to the sender\n        changePrank({ msgSender: users.naruto.account });\n        uint256 newMarginCollateralBalance = convertUd60x18ToTokenAmount(\n            address(wstEth), perpsEngine.getAccountMarginCollateralBalance(tradingAccountId, address(wstEth))\n        );\n        perpsEngine.withdrawMargin(tradingAccountId, address(wstEth), newMarginCollateralBalance);\n\n        //Price updated to make the position liquidatable\n        updateMockPriceFeed(uint128(fuzzMarketConfig.marketId), 8e22);\n\n        uint128[] memory accountsIds;\n        accountsIds = new uint128[](1);\n        accountsIds[0] = tradingAccountId;\n\n        changePrank({ msgSender: liquidationKeeper });\n        perpsEngine.liquidateAccounts({ accountsIds: accountsIds });\n    }\n```\n\nAs can be seen in the event emitted, the `liquidatedCollateralUsd` is `zero` even though the `requiredMaintenanceMarginUsd` is `4e21`and `liquidationFeeUsd` is `5e18`\n\n```solidity\nLogLiquidateAccount(keeper: ERC1967Proxy: [0x50795785161296B0A64914b4ee9285bAF70371Cd], tradingAccountId: 1, amountOfOpenPositions: 1,\n requiredMaintenanceMarginUsd: 4000002000000000000000 [4e21], marginBalanceUsd: -200000100000000000000000 [-2e23],\n liquidatedCollateralUsd: 0, liquidationFeeUsd: 5000000000000000000 [5e18])\n```\n\n**Suggestion**\n- Require users with open positions to maintain a minimum collateral balance, regardless of their PNL. \n- Discount positive PNL, reducing its collateral weight compared to actually deposited assets.\n- Allowing users to borrow deposited collateral without restrictions can create similar risks and should be carefully managed.\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue.

If their overall health score falls below a threshold, all positions are liquidated in a single transaction.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Incorrect Example\n\nConsider this code example:\n\n```solidity\n// load open markets for account being liquidated\nctx.amountOfOpenPositions = tradingAccount.activeMarketsIds.length();\n\n\n// iterate through open markets\nfor (uint256 j = 0; j < ctx.amountOfOpenPositions; j++) {\n    // load current active market id into working data\n    // @audit assumes constant ordering of active markets\n    ctx.marketId = tradingAccount.activeMarketsIds.at(j).toUint128();\n\n\n    // snip - a bunch of liquidation processing code //\n\n\n    // remove this active market from the account\n    // @audit this calls `EnumerableSet::remove` which changes the order of `activeMarketIds`\n    tradingAccount.updateActiveMarkets(ctx.marketId, ctx.oldPositionSizeX18, SD_ZERO);\n```\n\nBecause EnumerableSet does not guarantee element order and its remove function uses a swap-and-pop method for efficiency, removing an active market that is not the last in the list can disrupt the order of a user’s active markets.\n\nA malicious user can exploit this by opening multiple positions and triggering this corruption, causing liquidation attempts to fail with an array out-of-bounds error.\n\n**Suggestion**\nIterate over a memory copy of activeMarketIds using EnumerableSet::values instead of accessing storage directly.\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue.

By front-running liquidation attempts, they make themselves impossible to liquidate.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Incorrect Example\n\nBlocking the liquidation of PartyA\n\n```solidity(LiquidationFacetImpl.sol))\nfunction liquidatePartyA(address partyA, SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig) internal {\n         MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();\n \n         LibMuon.verifyPartyAUpnl(upnlSig, partyA);\n         int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(\n             upnlSig.upnl,\n             partyA\n         );\n         require(availableBalance < 0, \"LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent\");\n         maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA] = true;\n         maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] = upnlSig.timestamp;\n         AccountStorage.layout().liquidators[partyA].push(msg.sender);\n     }\n```\n\nWithin the `liquidatePartyA` function, it calls the `LibMuon.verifyPartyAUpnl` function.\n\n```solidity(LibMuon.sol)\n     function verifyPartyAUpnl(SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig, address partyA) internal view {\n         MuonStorage.Layout storage muonLayout = MuonStorage.layout();\n //        require(\n //            block.timestamp <= upnlSig.timestamp + muonLayout.upnlValidTime,\n //            \"LibMuon: Expired signature\"\n //        );\n         bytes32 hash = keccak256(\n             abi.encodePacked(\n                 muonLayout.muonAppId,\n                 upnlSig.reqId,\n                 address(this),\n                 partyA,\n                 AccountStorage.layout().partyANonces[partyA],\n                 upnlSig.upnl,\n                 upnlSig.timestamp,\n                 getChainId()\n             )\n         );\n         verifyTSSAndGateway(hash, upnlSig.sigs, upnlSig.gatewaySignature);\n     }\n```\n\nThe `verifyPartyAUpnl` function will take the current nonce of PartyA (`AccountStorage.layout().partyANonces[partyA]`) to build the hash needed for verification.\n\nWhen the PartyA becomes liquidatable or near to becoming liquidatable, it could start to monitor the mempool for any transaction that attempts to liquidate their accounts. Whenever a liquidator submits a `liquidatePartyA` transaction to liquidate their accounts, they could front-run it and submit a transaction to increment their nonce. When the liquidator's transaction is executed, the on-chain PartyA's nonce will differ from the nonce in the signature, and the liquidation transaction will revert.\n\nFor those chains that do not have a public mempool, they can possibly choose to submit a transaction that increments their nonce in every block as long as it is economically feasible to obtain the same result.\n\nGas fees that PartyA spent might be cheap compared to the number of assets they will lose if their account is liquidated. Additionally, gas fees are cheap on L2 or side-chain (The protocol intended to support Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, Fantom, Optimism, BNB chain, Polygon, Avalanche as per the contest details).\n\nThere are a number of methods for PartyA to increment their nonce, this includes but not limited to the following:\n\n* Allocate or deallocate dust amount\n* Lock and unlock the dummy position\n* Calls `requestToClosePosition` followed by `requestToCancelCloseRequest` immediately\n\n#### Example 2: Incorrect Example\n\nThe same exploit can be used to block the liquidation of PartyB since the `liquidatePartyB` function also relies on the `LibMuon.verifyPartyBUpnl,` which uses the on-chain nonce of PartyB for signature verification.\n\n```solidity(LiquidationFacetImpl.sol)\nfunction liquidatePartyB(\n..SNIP..\n         LibMuon.verifyPartyBUpnl(upnlSig, partyB, partyA);\n```\n\nPartyA can block their accounts from being liquidated by liquidators. With the ability to liquidate the insolvent PartyA, the unrealized profits of all PartyBs cannot be realized, and thus they will not be able to withdraw the profits.\n\nPartyA could also exploit this issue to block their account from being liquidated to:\n\n* Wait for their positions to recover to reduce their losses\n* Buy time to obtain funds from elsewhere to inject into their accounts to bring the account back to a healthy level\n\nSince this is a zero-sum game, the above-mentioned create unfairness to PartyB and reduce their profits.\n\nThe impact is the same for the blocking of PartyB liquidation.\n\n**Suggestion**\nIn most protocols, whether an account is liquidatable is determined on-chain, and this issue will not surface. However, the architecture of Symmetrical protocol relies on off-chain and on-chain components to determine if an account is liquidatable, which can introduce a number of race conditions such as the one mentioned in this report.\n\nConsider reviewing the impact of malicious users attempting to increment the nonce in order to block certain actions in the protocols since most functions rely on the fact that the on-chain nonce must be in sync with the signature's nonce and update the architecture/contracts of the protocol accordingly.\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue.

After reading the following vulnerability knowledge and understanding correct and incorrect examples, detect the problem in the contract code.\n\n### Vulnerability Knowledge\n\n**Liquidation reverts from token deny list**\nSome tokens, like USDC, have deny lists that allow token admins to freeze certain addresses, causing all transfer attempts to those addresses to revert. Many liquidation mechanisms use a \"push\" model, where tokens are automatically sent to designated addresses. If a protocol supports deny-listed tokens and liquidation attempts to send funds to a blocked address, the transaction will fail, making liquidation impossible.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Incorrect Example\n\nUpon liquidations, we call the following function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction _transferAssetsToLiquidator(address position, AssetData[] calldata assetData) internal {\n        // transfer position assets to the liquidator and accrue protocol liquidation fees\n        uint256 assetDataLength = assetData.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < assetDataLength; ++i) {\n            // ensure assetData[i] is in the position asset list\n            if (Position(payable(position)).hasAsset(assetData[i].asset) == false) {\n                revert PositionManager_SeizeInvalidAsset(position, assetData[i].asset);\n            }\n            // compute fee amt\n            // [ROUND] liquidation fee is rounded down, in favor of the liquidator\n            uint256 fee = liquidationFee.mulDiv(assetData[i].amt, 1e18);\n            // transfer fee amt to protocol\n            Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), assetData[i].asset, fee);\n            // transfer difference to the liquidator\n            Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nAs seen, we call `transfer()` on the `Position` contract which just transfers the specified amount of funds to the provided receiver. As mentioned in the contest README, USDC will be whitelisted for the protocol. If the `position` address is blacklisted for USDC, this transcation would fail and the liquidation for that user would brick. The user in charge of that position could increase his chance of getting blacklisted by using the `exec()` function which calls a particular function on a target (both have to be whitelisted by an owner). If they do malicious stuff and even worse, manage to find a vulnerability that they can exploit on the allowed target, they might get blacklisted which would brick liquidations for them, especially if their only deposited collateral token is USDC.\n\nEven worse, every user can call `addToken()` for USDC without having to deposit any USDC nor to have any USDC balance making this attack free, the only thing the user needs to make happen is to get blacklisted.\n\n**Suggestion**\nSwitch to a \"pull\" model, where users must manually claim their tokens instead of having them automatically sent.\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue.
