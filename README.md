## Bastet
Bastet is a comprehensive dataset of common smart contract vulnerabilities in DeFi along with an AI-driven automated detection process to enhance vulnerability detection accuracy and optimize security lifecycle management.

## Overview
Bastet covers common vulnerabilities in DeFi, including medium- to high-risk vulnerabilities found on-chain and in audit competitions, along with corresponding secure implementations. It aims to help developers and researchers gain deeper insights into vulnerability patterns and best security practices.

In addition, Bastet integrates an AI-driven automated vulnerability detection process. By designing tailored detection workflows, Bastet enhances AI's accuracy in identifying vulnerabilities, with the goal of optimizing security lifecycle management—from development and auditing to ongoing monitoring.

We strive to improve overall security coverage and warmly welcome contributions of additional vulnerability types, datasets, or improved AI detection methodologies.
Please refer to our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Together, we can drive the industry's security development forward.
